All objects around us exist in 3D dimensions means that they have some height, some width and some depth. But given all they displays are 2D means they have pixels aligned in height and width only there is not no depth. Then how do we represent all are 2D objects on a 2D screen. Will there are several computer algorithms to do these tasks. 
All these algorithms are computational expensive. So if any sequentially programmed generalized controller is going to handle these algorithms then it will be very slow. Thatâ€™s way GPU came in. So GPU is designed to perform parallel computational, but FPGAs are not limited by proprietary GPU libraries and can be optimized for individual applications.  To summarize we are going to build, imagine if the graphics rendering be box. Then input will be in the form of vertices in 3D coordinate systems and there will be pixels array to immediate measure the output.
