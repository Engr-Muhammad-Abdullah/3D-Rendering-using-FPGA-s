Rendering of 3D models is a computationally expensive task and often slow. With hardware customization and reprogrammable flexibility using FPGAs, highest performance can be achieved. So we are going to build customized hardware on a FPGA Cyclone IV E (DE0 nano board) to render 3D objects into images, and finally, display the rendered images on a monitor over VGA. I have used Verilog for the hardware implementation so that the code can be easily compiled for most FPGAs out there.
